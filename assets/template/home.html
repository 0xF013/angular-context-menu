<div context-menu="onRightClick(message);" class="panel panel-default" data-target="myMenu"
     ng-class="{ 'highlight': highlight, 'expanded' : expanded }">
  <div class="panel-body">
    Right-click anywhere within this panel
  </div>
</div>
<strong>Note:</strong> The position of the dropdown menu can get a little out of whack if you place the dropdown
  menu in a container with padding/margin/etc so it's best to place it as a direct child of the body element as is
  shown in this example.
